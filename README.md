# AStarSearch

This is a program created to build upon my understanding of the A* Search algorithm. When run a grid will appear with a start and end point, any grid location clicked will toggle between a wall/obstacle or a valid path tile. After clicking the start search button, the A* search will find the shortest path between the start and end location while avoiding the obstacles.

Run using: python astarsearch.py

Bugs: Currently is very slow and will take an especially long time to run if not given a valid path.
